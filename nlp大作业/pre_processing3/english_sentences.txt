We're traveling on a tight budget.
I gave it to the little boy.
English is a universal language and is used all over the world.
I want you to relax.
Tom has to do that again.
Who's at fault?
She didn't like her husband drunk.
Someday I'll run like the wind.
Do you know the difference between a microscope and a telescope?
You'll be punished if you break the law.
Please pass me the butter.
Women tend to live longer than men.
People love to talk.
Didn't you hear her speaking French?
I'll be back by seven or eight o'clock.
What symptoms do you have?
I have no idea of what's going on in there.
His comments about the book were favorable.
"I may be unsociable, but it doesn't mean I don't talk to people."
I've been very busy recently.
She has a flower in her hand.
Will you mail this letter for me?
She came home very late.
I can't figure him out.
Many people were waiting in line.
What do you think of this plan?
How old are your parents?
"Hi, my name's Tom. What's yours?"
I've had a headache for three days and I can't get rid of it.
That was pretty neat.
Where is the bank?
I'm not going to tell you until I tell Tom.
They were frightened.
My daughter likes egg yolks.
What's new?
What're you up to?
My room is twice as big as his.
I've finished reading the book.
I consider fruit to be the healthiest food.
"Frankly speaking, he's wrong."
I am interested in sports.
Has the movie started?
These scissors don't cut well.
These scissors don't cut well.
He'll be glad to see you.
It must be done more carefully.
It's business.
What else do you want me to say?
"Which do you like better, rock music or classical music?"
Mary won't listen to her friend's advice.
Tom is afraid to go out alone at night.
Tom needs to be told what to do.
I ate breakfast in my pajamas.
Tom needs to update his website.
I haven't been to Australia.
They say this old house is haunted.
Don't forget Tom is allergic to peanuts.
This is delicious.
"A few minutes later, the telephone rang."
That's Mary's husband.
You have a very nice family.
She had my mother take care of the baby.
He gave her a piece of paper.
The cake is too sweet.
I wish I were a good singer.
I don't like the way he speaks.
I'm so stupid.
Got it?
The students could not give an answer.
I need to go to work.
"No pain, no gain."
Every man has his price.
You dropped your pencil.
I got up early.
You have to finish this by 2:30.
I play tennis once in a while.
Tom baked some chocolate chip cookies.
My internet connection was cut off.
My heart was filled with happiness.
Can I see that one?
I guess I'll have to leave now.
I will do the shopping for her birthday.
The children are afraid of Tom.
She says you'll bring some friends along.
I was terribly confused by his question.
Let's pray.
Tom didn't want to do that.
Tom began talking.
He always plans a thing out carefully before he does it.
I would like to have a look at your collection of stamps.
They're digging a hole.
Are you busy at work?
I can't stand this pain any more.
I go to the office by bicycle except on rainy days.
We receive many telephone calls from abroad.
Is Tom helping Mary?
I can't find anything wrong with his theory.
What's the matter?
The mouse ran into the hole.
He is always forgetting things.
His horse jumped over the fence.
I had to choose between the two.
April showers bring May flowers.
It's really bad for your eyes.
She is now staying at her uncle's house.
She is walking.
I heard Tom scream.
We just moved in.
Tulips will bloom soon.
Could you help us after school?
What are you cooking?
He stayed at his aunt's house.
A true gentleman never betrays his friends.
What about you?
I'm sorry.
We talked until two in the morning.
I'm glad to hear that.
What were you and Tom doing yesterday?
Please take off your shoes.
Young children are often fascinated by science.
I do not think that he will come.
Some of the money was stolen.
Why were you late?
He was seen to go upstairs.
"You knew about this already, didn't you?"
That rumor soon spread.
I'm no longer your assistant.
He convinced me of his innocence.
What's your nickname?
The woman glared at us.
She is busy preparing supper now.
We are encouraged to use our imagination.
I'd like to see a doctor.
Would you like a tour?
Don't follow me.
Someone told me that this boy cannot hear.
This book is easy to read.
"Everyone, say cheese."
She so wants to go.
Interest rates and inflation were high.
Tom likes to make paper airplanes.
The door was kicked open.
Tom ran out of matches so he couldn't light the fire.
Are you going to school tomorrow?
How many books do you think you've read so far?
"Wherever you go, I will follow you."
Do you understand?
He is the tallest boy.
"On Sunday, I go to church."
The importation of rare wild animals to this country is strictly prohibited.
I already apologized.
This decision is final.
Where's your dog?
Lots of companies have implemented an eight-hour working day.
He grasped the rope with two hands.
Come on. I want to show you something.
There's no rush.
Throw it away.
We are spending the night at my uncle's house.
We swam in the lake.
I don't like studying.
Where's the next train going?
I slept a little during lunch break because I was so tired.
Children should drink milk every day.
I have a stomachache.
These pants fit me well.
How much longer will you stay in Boston?
My cell phone has a built-in digital camera.
I'm too sleepy to do my homework.
One of the dogs is alive.
Can I ask you a question?
He arrived in Tokyo yesterday.
He loved to laugh and enjoy life.
I can't go with you because I'm very busy.
Let's consider the worst that could happen.
There are many fish in this lake.
A thousand yen will do.
I am able to drive a car.
"Excuse me, how much is this sweater?"
Let's make some more.
I'll stop by your place on my way home.
I don't feel like eating sushi.
Are you for or against the plan?
It belongs to my brother.
Everything is normal.
Tom won't be here long.
Tom put his money in the safe.
Both you and I are men.
I want to participate.
I forget where I put my hat.
Let's meet in front of the theater.
He lied to me. That is why I am angry with him.
I find it much easier to speak French than English.
Are you able to play organ?
Beethoven was a great musician.
You know quite a lot about Sumo.
Can I help you?
She is lacking in common sense.
He has a lot of money in the bank.
"Pass me the salt, will you?"
He spent all night cramming for the test.
It's said that she loves him.
"Come on, hurry up."
Everybody was singing except me.
I don't know what day he'll come.
He slipped me a note.
Have you heard from him?
She gave us lots to eat.
Do you like rap?
Tom forgot to do his homework.
Tom had a hunch that Mary was seeing someone else.
I wish they would stop fighting.
I don't know if today is Tuesday or Wednesday.
Every rose has its thorn.
I slapped his face.
"""Pass me the salt, please."" ""Here you are."""
What made you so angry?
I hate Mondays.
We must make a new start.
Someone is watching.
Today is my sister's birthday.
He catches colds easily.
This is a bird sanctuary.
Tom is a strong guy.
Buy some milk on your way home.
I bought an old lamp.
I feel like a rest.
I'm expecting someone.
How much does a bus ticket cost?
Anybody may participate.
I have a lot of cats.
The situation went from bad to worse.
I wanted to go to the concert.
Which team are you a fan of?
We are not short of oil in this country.
I have no strength.
It is impossible to master English in a short time.
I don't want Tom to die.
I want you to wear this.
Tom isn't an elected official.
I received a letter written in English yesterday.
Where do you live?
No other mountain in the world is so high as Mt. Everest.
They don't like me.
I thought Tom would enjoy the party.
We sat talking about the remote past.
"A beautiful sunset, isn't it?"
I don't mind being criticized when I am wrong.
It's my turn to do that.
The firm went under due to lack of capital.
Pigs share certain characteristics with human beings.
We have to finish everything before Tuesday morning.
Tom checked the TV schedule to see what was on.
What did you make?
There's no possibility of his coming.
The flag is up.
Come inside.
It's impossible for me to explain it to you.
It's been a long war.
We spent the weekend with friends.
Who are you looking at?
We have to pull the weeds.
She teaches us French.
I want to go with you.
I'm glad that you guys are here.
We can't deny the fact that he's honest.
You need to go home right now.
"He survived an accident last year, but still drives recklessly."
She was aching from head to foot.
To be always honest is not easy.
The girl made an awkward bow.
Please tell me when to go.
Tom is spending more and more time in Boston.
They consider it impolite to disagree with someone they don't know very well.
He was scared when the monkey jumped at him.
Do it now.
The population of Shanghai is as large as that of Tokyo.
You've got a strong will.
Keep on smiling.
That's the stupidest thing I've ever said.
She was about to leave the house.
Tom doesn't like being treated like a child.
You guys are totally clueless.
I saw him enter the room.
I'm watching TV.
Give me your sandwich.
Where does your uncle live?
I'm used to staying up late.
He rode his bicycle there.
They work really hard.
I shot the horse because it had trouble breathing.
I caught a cold last month.
"Two adult tickets and three children's tickets to London, please."
I love you more than anybody else.
"I have a stomachache, doctor."
"I like this color, too."
I confessed to stealing the money.
Now is the time for action.
I'm out of time.
I invited him to the party and he accepted.
Tom didn't let his children go to Mary's party.
It's said that she's a well-known actress.
Tom wasn't surprised to see me.
It's time to wait now.
What would you like to eat?
I wake him at six every morning.
That's my favorite chair.
It's only a dream.
She's my classmate.
Tom wouldn't let anyone else in the room.
Wood burns.
I will do it tomorrow.
I don't understand at all.
They are peace-loving people.
Try to avoid making any more trouble.
She got to the station at seven.
Have you eaten your dinner already?
They fell into the conversation immediately.
Everybody knows his name.
I'll pick you up at three.
Part of his story is true.
Nobody noticed that she was absent until the end of the meeting.
It's worth the wait.
Don't worry about it. It's not your problem.
How are you doing today?
Nobody knows where he has gone.
A whale is a mammal.
Wait until the light changes to green.
I'll keep that book for myself.
"The handyman was supposed to arrive at twelve noon, but got stuck in a traffic jam for a few hours."
This is really difficult to deal with.
They've decided to get married next month.
I need it as quickly as possible.
The weather is nice tonight.
You or I will be chosen.
He's busy with his homework now.
He went to America to study medicine.
"All things considered, I think you should go back home and take care of your parents."
"Mom, can I go swimming?"
Mary has just come home.
Is that love?
We went out for a walk after dinner.
Tom comforted Mary.
Today is one of my friends' birthday.
The cottage was clean and tidy.
How old is your son?
"Turn on the light, please."
I always thought that Tom was a bit different.
I listened to some records last night.
My friend asked me if I was feeling all right.
I will finish my homework by nine.
She cannot do without her car.
I thought it was very good.
It's not that easy to learn a new language after fifty.
Tom really needs help now.
You can count on her.
What's the Wi-Fi password?
It's my turn to drive next.
I'm not sure when he'll come.
You must get rid of that bad habit.
Choose the one you like.
She smiled.
It's October already.
These peaches aren't very sweet.
When did you begin to learn English?
Tom couldn't help but smile.
I don't think I ordered that.
Whose is this?
What did you answer?
Were you playing tennis yesterday morning?
It's foggy outside.
I've been waiting here for thirty minutes.
"Because of his wealth, he was able to become a member of that club."
We watched the children play.
Can you drive a car?
You have the right to know.
"Bring me the newspaper, please."
I can teach you how to drive.
I like to eat.
Tom's speech was excellent.
"In the Edo period, moon-viewing parties were very popular."
Nobody's going to shed any tears if that old building gets torn down.
Everything went well.
Countless stars were twinkling in the sky.
We should ban advertising aimed towards children.
He went fishing instead of playing tennis.
What'll the results be?
"In doing anything, you must do your best."
They are proud of their daughter.
Do you have fresh strawberries?
You should think before you speak.
She got wet to the skin.
Let's take a break now.
Tom's girlfriend threatened to leave him.
I knew you'd find Tom.
Let's assume that'll happen.
I'd like to reserve a room in a hotel.
Have you ever seen Tom when he's angry?
It's quarter to eight now.
I'm afraid to die.
Come and dance with me.
Why do you want to know what I'm thinking?
What would you do if you had ten thousand dollars?
They studied English yesterday.
He just got home.
Tom heard this and got angry.
Is this your daughter?
Tom hasn't done anything.
Horses are stronger than deer.
See you soon!
He did not accept their invitation.
She scolded her son for being lazy.
I'm busy.
Put handcuffs on him.
I get scared just walking past him.
I met him on the street.
It's just your imagination.
We just have enough time to eat breakfast.
I didn't mean it.
"Have a nice day, Tom."
He kept a diary during the trip.
"In case the shipment is delayed, we have special delay insurance."
Write your name and address on this envelope.
Old dogs can learn new tricks.
I bought this camera yesterday.
Flies and mosquitoes interfered with his meditation.
I'm now rich enough to afford to get anything I want.
It seems that you're not having a good time here.
He told me not to tell lies.
English is studied in Japan.
I have a lot of homework to do.
He disappeared without a trace.
Tom lied to the others.
How rude of you!
"Above all, be patient."
"You like rain, don't you?"
I want Tom to win.
They only sell women's shoes here.
I play in a band.
My plans failed one after another.
She had a new dress made.
Tom said that Mary likes to drive.
I saw something strange in the sky.
I didn't even think of it.
All of us would like to get rid of nuclear weapons.
I didn't feel bad.
You'd better consult your doctor.
This is going to be a great trip.
It's too noisy in here.
You should've never interfered.
We've got what we need.
I can solve the problem by myself.
How did you feel about that?
We couldn't do that.
I almost never lie.
I took it for granted that he would keep his word.
Parking is prohibited here.
He invited me to his house.
Hand me my towel.
Please speak more loudly.
I must be getting close.
I want to travel with you.
We generally drink tea after a meal.
My father has never been abroad.
Their apples aren't as good as our apples.
The sale prices are written in red ink.
"He gave me 10,000 yen."
"Answer the telephone, will you?"
Mary and I plan to have two kids.
That's what I have to do.
Approximately thirty young people attended.
He will survive.
How long ago did the bus leave?
She likes to go to the library.
I was delayed by a traffic jam.
He gave me a nice Christmas present.
I'm working in Boston now.
A stay of execution was ordered at the eleventh hour.
I'm not married to Tom.
Tom told me that he'd lost his textbook.
Tom dyed his hair.
No one will talk.
"In the case of fire, dial 119."
I want you to grow up.
Please pick me up at the airport at five.
He had a smile on his face.
Are you kidding?
Not a day passes without traffic accidents.
Shut all the doors and windows.
My hobby is reading.
"You said Mary was beautiful, but I didn't think she would be this beautiful."
He made his son a chair.
None of them could understand what she was implying.
I'm Tom's father.
Why didn't you tell Tom that you were married?
"Even when I was a child, I was able to swim well."
I'll check your vision.
I think I left my wallet at home.
I want another beer.
How many apples do you want?
Do you feel like resting?
Only adults may watch that film.
The fuel gauge is broken.
The balloon was caught in the tree.
I need to find out when we need to be there.
He swims better than I do.
Where are you guys going?
My aunt made a new skirt for me.
You should do your homework now.
I'm almost never home.
She kept me waiting for 30 minutes.
That wasn't nice.
It was terrible.
"Nothing ventured, nothing gained."
She has traveled all over the globe.
What you're saying doesn't make sense.
I would like to see it.
Lend me some money if you have any.
She told me to open the window.
The sky was completely dark.
So where's the problem?
I'm going to attend the meeting.
He looks down on women.
Are you finished with your work?
Tom has never been on time.
She was hit by a car.
He's already a man.
No students were absent.
There's only a little milk left.
Do you know what he said?
Tom is studying to become a marine biologist.
She disappeared.
She gave me access to her records.
Why's Tom always so grumpy?
Anniversaries are important.
I'm very grateful for everything you've done for me.
Tom should be fired.
I heard someone come in.
I didn't find anything.
What do you think about it?
The baby was sound asleep in her mother's arms.
We made pancakes for breakfast.
The monkey climbed up a tree.
Tom rolled down his window.
We helped them as well.
He wouldn't look at my proposal.
I thought that Tom would sleep until noon.
I never thought it would come to this.
The batteries in my calculator are dead.
He called me a taxi.
You never listen to our advice.
Tom is living with his uncle now.
She almost drowned.
This place gives me a really bad vibe.
Christmas is around the corner.
You'd better not have eaten the cake.
I bought two bags of popcorn.
I don't believe the child came to Tokyo alone.
The toilet doesn't flush properly.
People still think Tom is a liar.
Here's the change.
I'd be happy to help you.
I belong to the swimming club.
Don't let me down.
A doctor was called in right away.
I'm ready to die.
When did you get here?
Ebola spreads from person to person through bodily fluids.
He never drinks alcohol.
The meeting ended at 4:00 p.m.
He painted a dog.
Try it once more.
Tom still doesn't know the truth.
She is going to Chiba Stadium.
I can drive a car.
I got something nice for you.
He crashed his car because someone tampered with the brakes.
I wish I could stop hiccuping.
I know a lot about ships.
He will be back in ten minutes.
I have a feeling he is right.
"If we don't hurry, we'll miss our train."
"Like a good wine, he improves with age."
"In the United States, school buses are yellow."
I can't believe Tom is getting married.
He became a member of this club five years ago.
May I eat that cake?
I'll see to it.
We hope a solution is found.
She filled her bag with apples.
Don't look down on others.
I guess it depends on the weather.
I'll wait another five minutes.
I'm never at home on Sundays.
I'm just a regular office worker.
I'm extremely tired.
She lived there about five years.
Is it true that Tom wants to paint his house green?
There is no hope of his recovery.
It looks like a duck.
I don't like your girlfriend.
How much is the bus fare?
I can't survive without air conditioning in the summer.
I had nothing to hide.
Ask him where he parked his car.
My wife wants to adopt a child.
I was afraid I'd be late.
Tom climbed down from the tree.
I think you should open an account here.
"If we don't keep walking, we'll be late."
Would you like something to eat?
Why do you need my help?
He works from nine to five-thirty.
They say that she was born in Germany.
Are you hungry?
She's a glamorous girl.
We'll begin tomorrow morning.
Can you come to the meeting tomorrow?
Have you been eating?
I just wanted to speak to Tom.
Most accidents happen near home.
What is Gestalt Therapy?
You work as hard as he did at your age.
He took a week off.
Please turn off the light before you go to sleep.
You're even taller than I am.
That was one of the best times of my life.
She wants to work at the hospital.
I often go swimming in the river.
I prefer coffee to tea.
My stomach's full.
Please find a solution to the problem.
Shall we go out for a walk?
People should be dancing.
Tom likes football.
I buy tapes.
Few things give us as much pleasure as music.
I'd like to see your sister.
You should study harder.
I'm impatient.
I want to become a teacher of Japanese.
I should have known better than to call him.
Turn the flame down low.
We saw many ships in the harbor.
Where did all that self-confidence come from?
I will ask him tomorrow.
Do you know where Tom lives?
"No matter what happens, I'm not changing my mind."
What is that?
It will be snowing when we arrive at Shiga Heights.
The girl is small for her age.
She applied her mind to her new job.
I'm considering studying in America next year.
We are good friends.
It has always been a pleasure to work with you.
Tom has no idea why his wife left him.
You're joking!
You don't look so well.
Tom took Mary to the hospital on the back of his motorcycle.
Tom's thirty.
"In my opinion, he is correct."
Everyone is waiting for Tom.
I think Tom will likely like this movie.
Mary grabbed her purse and left.
We've ordered Chinese food.
What do you advise me to do?
I owe everything to Tom.
Show him in.
He hasn't come yet.
How much sugar do you use?
Do I have to take this medicine?
That house appears deserted.
We should always obey laws.
There's not a moment to waste.
She forgave the boy for his rudeness.
I want you to come at once.
The man robbed her bag.
I'm very happy.
Riding double on a bicycle is dangerous.
Try not to forget anything.
I saw a dog swim across the river.
Would you please show me that skirt?
Please sit.
What's your favorite home-cooked food?
This is just what I wanted.
He talks too fast.
I'm not fond of her face.
She cooked herself a good meal.
Many of the workers died of hunger.
I think Tom probably likes you a lot.
I don't mind waiting for a while.
I love watching soccer games.
I'm learning how to type.
It may not be possible.
It's wrong to lie.
Both of my sisters are married.
Thank you ever so much.
You took the wrong key.
I took an art class last year.
He arrived in time for the meeting.
He likes jazz and so do I.
Where do you want to go?
Tom probably knows how to get to Mary's house.
It became quiet again in the forest.
Do you have siblings?
She was in trouble because she lost her passport.
I almost didn't meet her.
I'm playing football now.
Several dozen young people participated in the demonstration.
Do you know the reason why the sky looks blue?
There is a bank in front of the station.
You should ask your father for his advice and follow it.
We require your help.
Life without love is meaningless.
Please allow me to go.
Are you still living with your parents?
The doctor examined my throat.
Please tell me everything's OK.
He continued reading the book.
You should have done it earlier. It cannot be helped now.
I got this CD player for free.
They went to Tottori.
It would be nice to have a party.
Subtract three from eight and you get five.
This rug is handmade.
How much does this cost?
He consented to help the old lady.
I'm going to take a bath.
"I can read German, but I can't speak it."
He spends lots of money on clothes.
Are you studying English?
Who was in charge of today's party?
I'm listening to the radio.
He is in trouble.
I want that bag.
Everyone except Tom knew that he didn't need to do that.
She did nothing but cry all the while.
Tom is Mary's former husband.
You're really wonderful.
"If Tom is really alive, where is he?"
May I use your car today?
I am not stupid.
I'll scold him.
You won't be able to see anything without a flashlight.
This boy is my son.
Tom gave Mary a flashlight.
The dog looks hungry.
How did you spend your winter vacation?
How long will the train stop here?
The explanation is by no means satisfactory.
It is fun to speak in English.
Could I try this on?
My father is sweeping the garage.
I'm lucky.
Everyone I know uses Google.
Tell me what happened.
I didn't do anything during my vacation.
I can't stand his arrogance.
I want to emphasize this point in particular.
The dog was sleeping on the mat.
I'm afraid I have to go now.
Do you usually have tea for breakfast?
"He looks old, but he hasn't reached 30 yet."
He began to look for a job.
We are anxious about her safety.
Life is not all fun and games.
I want to go to school and study hard.
My briefcase is full of papers.
Their losses reached one million yen.
She has a cottage by the sea.
They were afraid of the big dog.
I've been busy today.
Is this your pencil?
It's unlikely that he did anything wrong.
He lives in a cozy little house.
We moved our bags to make room for the elderly lady to sit down.
No one knows if he loves her or not.
Nobody understands me.
I've got something I want to show you.
She went to the Takasu clinic.
She substituted margarine for butter.
Are you free in the afternoon?
He gives some meat to the dog.
These flowers bloom earlier than others do.
Tom pretended to not hear a thing.
Did you get my letter?
Could I borrow a pencil?
I don't know what time it is.
His father dedicated his life to science.
Can I have a look at that?
Will I see you tomorrow?
Tom asked Mary if she knew John's new telephone number.
You can call me anytime you like.
She traveled around the world last year.
I think about it often.
He is very tall.
The cat caught the rats.
This chair is made of plastic.
Why did you want to become a teacher?
Would you look after my cat?
He earns three times more than me.
Did you miss me?
Do you play any instrument other than the piano?
My parents aren't old yet.
You should apologize to Dad for not coming home in time for supper.
A plane is flying above the city.
Mistakes like these are easily overlooked.
Tom might want you to help him.
She had an appointment with the doctor.
Tom and Mary were alone.
There is a cottage beyond the bridge.
His lectures are very long.
Mary had to go to school.
The concert is about to start.
I worked as a piano tuner for many years.
A female friend of mine loves to go to gay bars with me.
They're always complaining.
Why don't you go home?

Yesterday he came back late.
I had never seen a windmill until I visited the Netherlands.
Can you wake me up at 7:00 tomorrow?
No one is listening to Tom.

Tom bought a car.
Give my love to your kids.
"If you don't hurry, you'll miss the train."
She's not a full-time employee of this company.

He lied to my face.
Tom took the hammer away from Mary.
Grammar is a very complex thing.
Tom jumped up from his chair.
It won't take long to finish the job.
"If he knew her phone number, he could call her."
This is a terrible mistake.
I'm not that easily intimidated.
Here is a letter for you.
My house is big.
I like to eat apples.
Collect your thoughts before you begin your work.
That's what I like.
Tom went into the kitchen and poured himself a cup of coffee.
How do you like your eggs done?
That's a good idea.
"""He'd like to have a coffee after work."" ""I would too."""
A wise man would not say such a thing.
He froze with fear when he saw the snake.
She squeezed the juice from many oranges.
I like walking alone.
I need another pillow.
Do you know this song?
He has a car.
"When she was three years old, her father died."

You shouldn't go out.
How many pens do you have?

Both of you are wrong.
She was envious of her cousin's success.
I'm sure they'll win.
Give me a ring tomorrow.
It's almost Christmas.
He applied for the scholarship.
Tom wants popcorn.
Why did you show me this?
I study for 3 hours every day.

I'm going to go sit down.
How's the weather there?
Are you working?
There are many beautiful parks in London.

She's nice to me.

I think it will be hot today.
Don't look a gift horse in the mouth.

She waved her hand until the train was out of sight.
He got hurt in the game yesterday.
Can you prove it?

How do I get to Chinatown?
Here's where they usually have dinner.

It's brand new.
I waited an hour for my friend.
What's my room number?
The cat is looking at the fish.
A lot of houses were washed away by the flood.
He likes watching baseball games on TV.
"Bring me a sheet of paper, please."
Do you know what color she likes?
We know him.
He called me up almost every day.
Don't forget the ticket.
He struck a match.
I like to walk in the country.
I don't want to be involved in that matter.
"People, old and young, all came out to greet the guests."
We're having an office party tomorrow.
I can start anytime.
I can eat anything.
He practiced every day at home.
Bring Tom here.
Don't shout at me.
Will you be there?
Tom remained a bachelor until his death.
The train was so crowded that I had to keep standing all the way.
Everybody knows that he is honest.
Tom hugged Mary.
She intended to become an actress.
You are blushing.
All my homework is done.
"If he is innocent, it follows that his wife is guilty."
We were able to catch the last train.
It isn't necessary to answer that letter.
Suit yourself.
What are they saying?
Nobody can stop me!
We make milk into cheese and butter.
I feel like taking a walk now.
Why did you come here so early?
You need to get your eyes checked.
The mother missed her daughter who was away at college.
I am not afraid of dying.
I hid in the tall grass.
I can't do any better.
I'm on my way back to Boston.

There was nobody in the garden.
What did you do last Christmas?
Old people get up very early.
Would you like me to get you something from the supermarket?
Who is that?
These are our children.
Tom isn't smiling.
She is getting better day by day.
Can this be eaten?
You look surprised.
My aunt made me a new skirt.
He stopped for a quick cigarette.
Do you know how to eat with chopsticks?
Do you want any of these flowers?
The school needed a new teacher.
Tom probably knew who I was.
"He said he did not know the man, which was a lie."
Tom can't account for his whereabouts on the day that Mary was murdered.
After a storm comes a calm.
Don't worry about it.
He shut the door.
He is fluent in French.
The girl did not say anything.
If you listen closely enough you'll be able to hear it.
I found a beautiful shell on the shore.
She thought that he was wasting electricity.
Did you bring an umbrella with you?
This house is haunted.
These dirty socks stink.
That's a hard question to answer.
We buy eggs by the dozen.
I gave Tom a going-away present.
Money can't buy happiness.
He told me to wash my face.
Let's play tennis in the afternoon.
I'm three years younger than you.
It was a quiet winter's evening.
I got him to polish my shoes.
You might want to discuss it with Tom.
Have you seen my glasses anywhere?
What type of work do you do?
We got lost in the forest.
She studied Japanese after dinner.
You should seriously consider working here.
He won't go on to graduate school.
What do you want to do?
Tom can't speak French very well.
Turn the TV off.
She asked me a question.
That's exactly what I've been telling Tom.
I've got a frog in my throat.
Tom is trying to find Mary a job.
Why don't you come visit us?
I'm famished.
Tom admitted that he'd killed Mary.
It'll take too much time for Tom to get here.
Do you think animals have a soul?
I am alarmed by your irresponsible attitude.
My father goes jogging every morning.
We encountered a lot of difficulties on the expedition.
That's not what I told Tom.
Many English words are derived from Latin.
He cannot have done such a thing.
Tom doesn't believe he could do that.
Is it large enough?
We were crowded into the small room.
Nobody's laughing.
Don't blame Tom for what Mary did.
I dropped my fountain pen.
Tom told us this morning that he and Mary were moving to Boston.
"Tom just got divorced, too."
I think it's very difficult.
Be kind.
Tom never did that when he was younger.
Please wash it.
I promised Tom that I wouldn't say anything.
You're the one who must decide.
"She was only frightened, not injured."
She is a charming woman.
He saw her and blushed.
Turn up the radio a little bit.
Give me something to drink.
I'll give you this money.
I had sore legs the next day.
Let's take a look.
You must hurry up.
Have you read this book yet?
I'll sue you.
Can you give me a discount?
This is my favorite.
I finished reading the book last night.
It's just what I wanted.
He behaved as if he were crazy.
Tom seemed surprised.
I shouldn't have done that.
You've got to be joking.
He always leaves the window open when he sleeps.
Tom said that he was really jealous.
Do they like oranges?
Has the bell rung?
He hid himself behind the door.
I need some help with my work.
Does anybody want coffee?
Tom found a new way to announce his news.
Tom doubled his investment in a year.
Do you know how far it is from the station to city hall?
I'm not guilty.
It's so different now.
Tom ate only one sandwich.
Are you picking me up at 7 tomorrow morning?
Can you do bookkeeping?
Here is your dog. Where is mine?
Tom says he left a note.
My father's hobby is growing roses.
The mechanic assembled the engine.
He bought her a sweater.
Her skin is as white as snow.
Who painted this beautiful picture?
They sleep in separate bedrooms even though they're married.
Please let me try the game.
"Not knowing what to do, I asked the teacher for advice."
I've promised Tom that I'd be there.
It's been raining since last night.
Imagine that you have a time machine.
I don't think he can help you.
I feel relieved.
I am looking forward to seeing you.
He has a strong sense of responsibility.
You're blushing.
My room is three times as large as yours.
Where're the shoes?
You can stay here till the snow stops.
There's somebody in there.
We've decided not to fire you.
Tom whispered something to Mary and she smiled.
"Give me your opinion, please."
He died yesterday.
Are you all right?
Think about this.
What time does the play begin?
I fed the dog.
Tom has been here since 2013.
Tom is ill.
They told me it was your fault.
These shoes are too small.
Who are my real parents?
They were buried in a mass grave.
She is busy preparing for the trip.
She got out of the car.
Tom is in the kitchen making tea.
Your manners aren't very good.
I'm afraid she may have the mumps.
Would you lend me your pencil?
Where did you take your shoes off?
Stop!
He caught a cold.
We haven't lost hope.
She's sure to succeed.
Mary likes milk very much.
The cat is not dead.
The life span of a butterfly is short.
I went on reading.
We should sit down.
She likes to go to the sauna.
Say it in English.
Tom didn't want Mary to know he didn't know how to do that.
The garden was filled with flowers.
She looks blue for some reason.
Her socks are gray.
You can't get ahead if you don't work hard.
He made his way through the crowd.
"At first, I thought they were sick."
Will you drive me to the hospital?
I'm still the boss here.
Is there any possibility of his resigning?
Is she a computer programmer?
He couldn't hold his temper any longer.
Why do you think that I'm thinking about you?
The pressure was tremendous.
Maybe he will be a good teacher.
We're all at risk.
I have a pair of shoes.
I'm sure Tom can't swim.
The heater is broken.
"Between you and me, what is your opinion of her?"
Mary closed the door quietly.
These glasses are cool.
Yesterday's board meeting was a big success.
Do you have enough money?
This is an old building.
The man finally confessed.
You should've come earlier.
She died of stomach cancer.
Thank you for your invitation.
"Yes, I have student ID."
I simply don't understand this.
He hadn't eaten in two days.
I don't know where Tom was going.
"""When will you come back?"" ""It all depends on the weather."""
We have space for two beds.
She went over the list to see if her name was there.
She doesn't know how to play golf.
You're in better shape than I am.
"If for some reason they come early, please tell them to wait."
Her hair grew back.
I use Firefox.
We use a lot of water every day.
The population of London is much greater than that of any other British city.
Our house has three bedrooms.
"As long as good people do nothing, evil will triumph."
The dolphin and trainer communicated much better than we expected.
You have three minutes to surrender.
I like your car.
I rented a house with a garage.
This is none of your business.
You should take up golf.
I canceled my hotel reservation.
Your tie looks good.
I have to reduce my expenses this month.
He is a teacher.
"You're not satisfied, are you?"
I think that our living together has influenced your habits.
Thanks anyway.
What time did you get up this morning?
That was the first time that a man walked on the moon.
He is a bad driver.
"Scary, isn't it?"
Just let Tom speak.
He is not as intelligent as his older brother.
The number of traffic accidents seems to be on the increase.
Come again next week.
His house is somewhere around here.
The old man is blind in one eye.
What's Tom given us?
"Keep your eyes wide open before marriage, half shut afterwards."
Tom chewed on his pencil.
I'll be able to assist you.
You deserve the prize.
Let's take a bus.
What's the round-trip fare?
She pretended to be a student.
Could you tell me?
You must make up for the loss.
I can do that for Tom.
I watched TV this morning.
You are safe here with me.
Tom didn't know what Mary was talking about.
It is easy to swim.
They went to the station by car.
You can delete that now.
Your answer is right.
The boys' bicycle is in the garage.
Please pull over.
I will teach you to play chess.
Pour melted butter over the popcorn.
Nobody knows the truth.
She banged the table with her fist.
Bee stings can be very painful.
You have to turn in the reports on Monday.
Everyone but Tom knew that he didn't need to do that.
Tom probably knows someone who can teach us French.
Tom carefully wiped his fingerprints off the knife.
How long have you lived in Boston?
How about going out tonight?
I'd like you to go there.
This question is very simple.
Can you really not swim?
That's the answer.
Maybe I should just tell Tom the truth.
The couple had a son.
I almost drowned.
"I've never lived on a farm, but both of my parents grew up on farms."
Scientists haven't found a cure for cancer yet.
Tom is boring.
There were risks.
I know I did an awful thing.
That's so perfect.
Will you go out tomorrow?
Does Tom know you work here?
He plays golf every weekend.
She pushed him out the window.
I didn't tell anyone what time I'd be arriving.
I will finish it by tomorrow afternoon.
Tom told me he didn't win.
The two of you have ruined my life.
I envy the friendship Tom and Mary have.
Tom went to Boston three years ago.
I can't distinguish him from his brother.
We took strong measures to prevent it.
"I'm coming home, Tom."
What do you want to get Tom for Christmas?
Now where did I put the key?
I hope that Tom has learned his lesson.
It's already time for us to go.
He'll wait for you.
I miss my children.
Hang on!
Everybody wants to sit beside her.
You're an idiot.
It wasn't you who told me about this.
A bicycle will rust if you leave it in the rain.
Tom is sitting on the grass.
Get real.
Write it down before you forget it.
I'm interested in Asian history.
I hope I'll see you again soon.
The ladies' room is on the third floor.
This pamphlet is free of charge.
This book has many pictures.
You made it.
These shoes are hers.
I'm feeling good this morning.
He got his meaning across to me.
Are you free tonight?
It was not very cold yesterday.
I'm a stranger here myself. I'm afraid I can't help you.
I'm praying.
That wasn't my intention.
No words can express her deep sorrow.
You should be a diplomat.
Skating is one of my hobbies.
I thought Tom would win.
"To put it bluntly, he's mistaken."
"It'll cost about 10,000 yen."
I don't know my father's annual income.
He's my Mr. Right.
The boy has learned to read.
You live in my heart.
Tom wouldn't dare show his face around here again.
He gave me whatever help I needed.
My brother is now in Australia.
I'll help you escape.
He shot at me.
Tom continued his investigation.

Ask her when she comes back.
I like your way of thinking.
It is just your imagination.
He explained the literal meaning of the sentence.
Do you have a points card?

I am very concerned about his health.
I'd bought it the week before.

We want candy.
Who's going to believe you?
Do you offer any all-day tours?
He sent a card to Mary.
One of the students didn't come today.
Everybody knew Tom was good at French.
This chair is uncomfortable.
Why didn't you do it?
Are you making fun of me?

What nonsense are you talking now?
Are they both the same?

She waited for you for two hours.
He appeared on TV last night.
Isn't that good enough?
I remember seeing you last year.
"Sorry, I've got my hands full now."
Thank you very much for everything.
Everything comes to those who wait.
Cover your head when you are in the sun.
We still don't know why.

Please tell me.
I played here last week.
The train came on time.

He suddenly became very happy.
He sometimes makes dinner for us.
The boy got in through the window.
He doesn't seem to be aware of the conflict between my father and me.
